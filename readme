InterQL
=======

Overview
--------
InterQL is an SQL-like query language server designed for retrieving information about content on the internet. It provides a structured interface for querying and extracting data from online sources, leveraging a custom parsing engine to process user-defined requests.

TODO
----
- [x] Parsing Engine: Implemented core functionality for parsing SQL-like queries
- [ ] Data Retrieval: Integrate mechanisms for fetching and processing internet content

Status
------
The project is actively under development. The parsing engine is complete, enabling support for query interpretation. Future work will focus on implementing data retrieval capabilities.

Usage
-----
Currently, InterQL can parse queries such as "VERIFY ssl.cert.issuer contains 'Let''s Encrypt' in example.com". To build and test the parser:
1. Run `make` to compile the InterQL binary.
2. Execute `./InterQL` to see the parsed output of a sample query.

See queries.txt file for other types of supported requests.
